# This is the initial pattern of Admin dashboard

## All Users Part

I try to separate users by location, this is easier for user to check the users detail in each location.

The icon represent one person, when you click the icon you can view this person's details about their consumption and files.

## Charts Part

This is a visual display center of data. We can choose a type of graph to show the data visually.

## Tables Part

This way we show the data in table, this way we can see more details of the data.
